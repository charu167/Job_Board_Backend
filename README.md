# Job Board Backend

## Description

The **Job Board Backend** is a backend application built using **Node.js** and **Express.js**, with **TypeScript** for type safety. The application also integrates **Elasticsearch** for robust search functionality. This README provides step-by-step guidance to set up and run the backend on your local development environment.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure the following tools are installed on your system:

- **Node.js**: Download and install from the [official website](https://nodejs.org).
- **npm**: Comes bundled with Node.js.
- **TypeScript**: Install globally by running:
  ```bash
  npm install -g typescript
  ```
- **Elasticsearch**: Download from the [official Elasticsearch website](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch).

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the project repository and navigate to the project folder:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd job-board-backend
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the required project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Elasticsearch

Place the downloaded Elasticsearch folder in the root directory of the project. The folder structure should look like this:

```plaintext
job-board-backend/
├── elasticsearch/
├── src/
├── dist/
├── package.json
└── start-elasticsearch.sh
```

Start Elasticsearch by running the provided script:

```bash
./start-elasticsearch.sh
```

### 4. Compile TypeScript

Compile the TypeScript code into JavaScript:

```bash
tsc
```

### 5. Start the Server

Run the compiled JavaScript code to start the backend server:

```bash
node dist/index.js
```

## Project Structure

The project structure is as follows:

```plaintext
job-board-backend/
├── elasticsearch/         # Elasticsearch files
├── src/                   # Source files (TypeScript)
│   ├── controllers/       # Controller logic
│   ├── models/            # Database models
│   ├── routes/            # Route definitions
│   ├── services/          # Business logic
│   └── index.ts           # Application entry point
├── dist/                  # Compiled JavaScript files
├── start-elasticsearch.sh # Script to start Elasticsearch
├── package.json           # Dependency management
├── tsconfig.json          # TypeScript configuration
└── README.md              # Project documentation
```

---

## Notes

- Ensure **Elasticsearch** is running before starting the server.
- The `dist/` directory is created after running the `tsc` command and contains the compiled JavaScript files.
- Use `nodemon` during development to watch for changes and restart the server automatically.
